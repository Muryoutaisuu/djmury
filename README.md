*still in progress*

Hey. I'm Muryoutaisuu. I like it, to write little scripts. When I found the service plug.dj I wanted to gain points as fast as possible. Soon I found out that some bots were published already. But, as I am an informatician, I wanted to create my own bot. And so I came to this little script.

It doesn't do much yet, but I want to work on it as I have time.

Funcionalities

This script can do some little things, e.g. autowoot ;-). It's basically a console-script, so don't expect some high quality buttons, which will change your behaviour on click. Nevertheless, I'm thinking about some links to activate some functions, e.g. autowoot on/off.

The first bot I used was at the same time the bot, I used to get some information about API and functions. Here it is: *https://github.com/ConnerGDavis/Plugbot*
