{"name":"DjMury","tagline":"The booklet for plug.dj","body":"# DJMury\r\n*still in progress*\r\n\r\nHey. I'm Muryoutaisuu. I like it, to write little scripts. When I found the service plug.dj I wanted to gain points as fast as possible. Soon I found out that some bots were published already. But, as I am an informatician, I wanted to create my own bot. And so I came to this little script.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't do much yet, but I want to work on it as I have time.\r\n\r\n## Funcionalities\r\nThis script can do some little things, e.g. autowoot ;-). It's basically a console-script, so don't expect some high quality buttons, which will change your behaviour on click. Nevertheless, I'm thinking about some links to activate some functions, e.g. autowoot on/off.\r\n\r\n### Cookies\r\nIn the current version, this bot doesn't create and use any cookies. So it isn't possible to save actions like autowoot etc. to the next session. So please stay calm and use your commando line :-)\r\n\r\n## Ideas\r\nI'm open to all kind of Ideas. However, I'm not the best at JavaScripting :-).\r\n\r\n### Current Ideas\r\nOne of my ideas is it to create a working Keylistener. I already tried some things, but it never really worked out. However, I'll stick to it.\r\n\r\n## Inspiration\r\nThe first bot I used was at the same time the bot, I used to get some information about API and functions. Here it is: *https://github.com/ConnerGDavis/Plugbot*\r\n\r\n## By the way\r\nI am **not** native! So please don't flame me because of my bad english. Nevertheless, if you want to help me, just write an E-Mail :-).\r\n\r\nYour loveliest, Muryoutaisuu â™¥\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n***\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
